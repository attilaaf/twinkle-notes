* Adding a friend
 Before adding a friend, first you need to know the [help:twinkle-id, Twinkle ID] of your friend, then you should make sure your profile is complete and your space is hosted.
# Go to /Home->Friends/ and click on [i:user-plus];
# Put in the Twinkle ID and send request;
# Wait for acceptance;
# Confirm.
 When you send your request, you are actually sending it to your friend's host. So obviously, your friend must be hosted too.
