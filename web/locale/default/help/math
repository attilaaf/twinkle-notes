*Writing math in notes. 

We assume you are already familiar with writing math in LaTeX. If not, you might want to take some time and learn it. You can write `$E=mc^2$` for $E=mc^2$. If you prefer that the formula stands on its own line, you can write `$$E=mc^2$$`, so that it looks like: $$E=mc^2$$
