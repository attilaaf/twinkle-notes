* Master password

 The first time you use Twinkle Notes, you will be required to set up a master password.  The password is used to encrypt a list of keys that will be actually used to encrypt space storage. This way you can change the password without having to re-encrypt all your data.

 You should use only one master password on all your devices. Otherwise you may not be able to import a space from another device because the exported string is encrypted with the password on that device.

 Please choose your master password carefully and make sure you remember your master password. We can't recover your password if it is lost. Your password never leaves your device.
