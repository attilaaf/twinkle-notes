* Inviting a member
 Sometimes you want to work closely with a group of people on a shared knowledge base. For that line of work, collaboration via note sharing becomes too cumbersome, disorganized and sometimes unreliable. It becomes necessary to create a shared space and then invite your team members to the same space.

 You create a shared space like an ordinary space and then add your team members one by one first as *friends*. Then you can change their roles from *friend* to *member* by going to their page. (Clicking on a user in friends list will go to that user's page.) 

Every *member* can see all the notes and files, except private chats of the space owner. You can disable a member later by changing its role to *blocked*.
