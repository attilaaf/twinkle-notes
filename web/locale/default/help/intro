Welcome to Twinkle Notes! 

Twinkle Notes will help you build your own personal knowledge base. It's private, cross-platform, and works offline. It can sync across devices without the server knowing your data.

 In Twinkle Notes, we value data privacy and user ownership above anything else. Your notes are stored in a digital space you own. No mobile phone nor email is required to create a space. When you create a space, a owner key is created and encrypted by your passphrase. The space owner key is used to encrypt data in your space. From the owner key, we can derive a unique id which becomes your identity. No one can take your space away from you as long as you keep the owner key safe.

 In Twinkle Notes, you can create a space and invite members to it. Your family members or team members can share and contribute to the same knowledge base.

 Don't take our words for what we promise -- Twinkle Notes is open source.
