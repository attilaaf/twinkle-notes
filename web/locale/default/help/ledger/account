*Accounts.

An account is where money come and go. It can be an actual bank account, a stock broker account, or just anything you choose. For example, you can create a new account `Expenses/Groceries` to track your shopping bills.

Normally you organize accounts into categories. By default, Twinkle will offer to create 5 top level account categories for you, such as:
- *Assets*. Cash, savings.
- *Liabilities*. Your credit cards, loans, mortgages.
- *Expenses*. Rents, groceries, travels.
- *Income*. Salaries, sales.
- *Equity/Opening balance*. This account is for balancing the initial funds of new accounts. Below is such a transaction that sets the initital fund of `BankA` to 100 USD:
```
2020-01-01 Assets/BankA            100 USD
2020-01-01 Equity/Opening balance -100 USD
```
A category can have sub categories. For example,
```
Expenses/
   Interest/
     Mortgage
```

The current value of an account is displayed in two ways, one in terms of default currency, and one by units.
