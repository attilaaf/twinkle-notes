* Introduction to ledger

Twinkle Ledger is a double entry accounting tool to help you manage your personal financial information.  If you are constantly puzzled by your own spending or investments, then keeping a ledger will be of great help. Since your ledger may contain sensitive information and should be kept in private, Twinkle is the perfect place for storing those data.

Twinkle Ledger keeps track of where money come and go with [help:ledger/transaction,transactions]. Each transaction records money flows between [help:ledger/account,accounts]. In a transaction, there must be some source accounts where money is flowing out, and some destination accounts where money is coming in. The sum of out-flows must equal to the sum of in-flows. 

Twinkle Ledger is started with a default currency, but you can have [help:ledger/units,multiple currencies and commodities] in your transactions. If a transaction involves other currencies or commodities, you will need to provide a unit price for them.

Twinkle Ledger is largely inspired by [https://www.ledger-cli.org/:ledger-cli].
