* Basics of note taking.
 
Notes are written in a plain text format. There is an artificial limit of note size (2000 bytes), so that you are encouraged to create many short notes instead of one long note. 

You can add all kinds of things to a note, including links, drawings, diagrams, files, images, pdf, etc. They are all represented in the plain text, with references to the actual data (what we call "blob").

 You can create a note either as a standalone one, or add it to an existing note like an email thread, or add it as a sub branche inside a note. You can also comment on a note. Since you can create links in a note, you can grow a forest of notes that are structural and interconnected.
 
Each note keeps its history of revisions. You can look into previous versions of a note and see how it has developed over time.
