*Formatting notes.
 
Notes are written in plain text. By adding special markups, notes can have different text styles.

`*bold*` turns into *bold*, `/italic/` turns into /italic/, and `_this_` shows _this_ with underline. To display verbatim text inline, use =~verbatim~=. To display code inline, use =`code`= or `=code=`. For multi-line code, use `===`:
```
===
This is meant to be a cute bunny
 (\(\
 (-.-)
 o_(")(")
===
```
You can also use =```= in place of `===`. If you want to quote something, you can write
===
> What I cannot create, I do not understand.
===
which will be turned into
> What I cannot create, I do not understand.
