Space is a place to create notes, to explore notes, and to receive notes from your friends.  You can also invite friends to collaborate in the same space.

 Your ownership of the space is protected by a pair of keys which are generated automatically. From the keys, a unique space ID is derived with the same algorithm used by Bitcoin. In fact it looks just like a wallet address. The space ID effectively becomes your identity.

Please keep in mind that we can't access your keys. You are responsible to backup and safeguard your own keys.
