Space is a place to create notes,
 to explore notes,
 and to receive notes from your friends.
 You can also invite friends
to work in the same space.
 
Your ownership of the space is protected
by a pair of keys which will be generated
automatically.
From the keys, a unique space ID will be 
derived with the same algorithm
used by Bitcoin.
In fact it looks just like a wallet address.
The space ID will become
one of your identities.

We can't access your keys.
You are responsible to backup and safe guard
your own keys.
