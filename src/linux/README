Twinkle Notes for Linux

Based on Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).

How to Build 
============

Dependency:
 - openssl 1.1
 - cef for linux

   http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html#linux64_builds
   Locate cef_binary_3.3538.1852.gcb937fc_linux64 and download and
   put binary files under lib directory:

   src/linux/lib:
     cef_binary_linux64
        include
        Debug
        Release
        ...

   You should try to build cef-project, and then
   copy libcef_dll_wrapper.a to cef_binary_linux64/Release


To build the project, simply:
    make

You will find all necessary files in './build' folder,
and you should run the twinkle program from that directory.

To build a deb package:
    make deb
