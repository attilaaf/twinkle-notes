Before you open the solution file, do the following:
1. twinkle-lisp is also checked out under the same parent directory as twinkle-notes.
   Make sure twinkle-lisp/lib/windows contains openssl/zlib/pthreads binaries.
   See twinkle-lisp/README.
   Download prebuilt: https://static.twinkle.app/files/prebuilt/lib-windows.zip
2. use 'mklink' to create a symbolic link. Open command prompt as Administrator.
   cd twinkle-notes
   mklink /d lisp ..\twinkle-lisp\lisp
3. Download cef binary
   Go to: http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html#windows32_builds
   Look for cef_binary_3.3538.1852.gcb937fc_windows32

   You must put cef binary inside lib directory:

      src\windows\lib:
        cef-binary-windows32
          include
          Debug
          Release
          ...

After you open the solution file, go to the project properites,
make sure debugging Environment variable TWK_DIST is set:

  TWK_DIST=$(SolutionDir)..\..\..

Now, you can build and run Twinkle Notes inside VS2015.
